### Main App Configuration

This file should contain the main `app` configurations only. Many of the `Express app` settings can be configured in `server.appSettings` dirrectly. For full documentation about settings see [Server Configuration](https://github.com/SorinGFS/webaccess/tree/master/config/servers).

The reason for the existence of this config is to allow setting the application differently depending on the purpose without requiring modification of the main `index.js` file.
